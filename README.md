# Base Converter with Tkinter

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python's `tkinter` library. The application allows users to convert numbers between different bases, including binary (2), octal (8), decimal (10), hexadecimal (16), base-18, and base-24.

## Features

- **Dynamic Base Selection**: Users can select the input base from a dropdown menu.
- **Real-Time Input Placeholder**: The input field updates its placeholder text based on the selected base.
- **Multi-Base Conversion**: Converts the input number to all supported bases simultaneously.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Invalid Input" for incorrect or unsupported inputs.

## How to Use

1. Enter a number in the input field.
2. Select the base of the input number from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the results in all supported bases.

## Requirements
